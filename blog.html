            <h3>Why I Chose a Higher Certificate Instead of a Gap Year</h3>
            <p><em>Written by Litha Nondi</em></p>
            <p>When I finished high school, my marks weren’t strong enough to get into the degree I wanted. I felt discouraged and unsure of what to do next. Many of my friends were taking gap years, hoping things would change but I didn’t want to wait.</p>
            <p>Through the Youth Development program, I learned about higher certificates and how they can be a stepping stone to a diploma or degree. I applied, got accepted, and now I’m thriving in my studies. I’m proud of the path I chose, and I want other students to know: your journey doesn’t have to be perfect to be powerful.</p>
            <p>Choosing a higher certificate gave me momentum, confidence, and a clear direction. It’s not a shortcut it’s a smart start.</p>
